Hi,

I’m Alwin. I have a Master’s degree in Data Science from the University of Amsterdam, I am a certified public accountant in the Netherlands and I live in Zurich, Switzerland. I got the opportunity to move abroad and work in an international environment because I have always applied my knowledge about data to my non-programming job: accountancy. Which practically means: every time I need to solve an accounting problem, I solve this problem and automate my work using the tools described in this handbook.

I created this handbook because in my non-programming job, I see countless opportunities to deal with data better. And these opportunities are not just within my domain of accounting and finance: any job that requires dealing with data provides these opportunities. The opportunities are endless because data is everywhere. I became a more effective and efficient accountant because I learned to deal with data well.

I want to help you deal with data as well so that you can excel at your non-programming job. That is why I wrote this handbook. I hope you can use it to your advantage. I’m always open for questions, comments or a chat in general to help you deal with data. You can reach me on LinkedIn or email at alwin@datahandbook.email.
